# Using GEDI and Sentinel Imagery to investigate mangrove heights.

A repository examining the use of packages in python and R to investigate mangrove heights. 

The 3 R code files are demonstrations of the model with;
1) Anamolous GEDI data.
2) All bands of Sentinel 2.
3) NVDI index.

The python file demonstrates reproducibility of the above R code in a python environment and plots the feature 
importance scores.
