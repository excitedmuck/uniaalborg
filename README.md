# Using GEDI and Sentinel Imagery to investigate mangrove heights.

A repository examining the use of packages in Python and R to investigate mangrove heights. 

The 3 R code files are demonstrations of the model with;
1) Anamolous GEDI data.
2) All bands of Sentinel 2.
3) NVDI index.

The Python file demonstrates the reproducibility of the above R code in a Python environment and plots the feature 
importance scores. 

To run the code; 
- Download the files natively to your folder
- Download Sentinel Imagery from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KVeZrCYU8rWJu3VrheY5y7H22QvZb9tX?usp=sharing
