# Using GEDI and Sentinel Imagery to investigate mangrove heights.

A repository examining the use of packages in python and R to investigate mangrove heights. 

The 3 R code files are 
1) Anamolous GEDI data.
2) All cleaned Bands used.
3) Using an NVDI index.

The python file demonstrates reproducibility of the above R code in a python environment and plots the feature 
importance scores, etc to demonstrate that.
